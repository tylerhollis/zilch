http://zilchzilch.bitballoon.com/

// Rules:
// Played with 6 dice
// Game 10,000 points
// To open 750 points

// Points:
// 1's = 100
// 5's = 50
// Three of a kind = 100x number on dice (except three 1's = 1000)
// Six of a kind = 6000
// 1,2,3,4,5,6 (straight) = 2000
// 1,1,6,6,3,4 = 1600
// 1,2,2,3,3,3 = 6x next roll of dice
// 3,3,3,3 + 1,1 or 5,5 = 1200 + 100x face value of next roll
// Three pairs = 1200
// Two triples = 2200

// Roll 6 dice - if points are made put those dice aside and roll remaining dice - if more points are made put those dice aside and roll remaining dice - continue until you roll no points in which case you ZILCH and lose your points for that turn OR you roll points on all six dice in which case you may re-roll all six dice. You may "Stay" to add your points to your score total and end your turn at any time. Remember if a roll does not make any points you get ZILCH and your turn is over.
// You MUST SCORE 750 POINTS IN ONE TURN TO GET ON THE BOARD.
// When someone reaches 10,000 points or more everyone gets one turn to beat that person.
